            - For threshold workouts, use time-based durations, not distance
            - Generate exactly ${numLT1Workouts} LT1 workouts (80-83% MHR) and ${numLT2Workouts} LT2 (85-88% MHR) workouts.
            - Each LT1 workout, excluding warmup and cooldown, should total ${thresholds.LT1 * 60} seconds. All reps within a single LT1 workout must be the same duration. The allowed rep durations are exactly 360, 540, or 720 seconds. Do not mix different durations in the same workout.
            - Each LT2 workout, excluding warmup and cooldown, should total ${thresholds.LT2 * 60} seconds. All reps within a single LT2 workout must be the same duration. The allowed rep durations are exactly 180, 360, or 540 seconds. Do not mix different durations in the same workout.
            - Threshold workout rep to rest time should be 3:1
            - Return workouts only â€” do not assign to specific days.
            - Do not include easy runs, off days, long runs, or hill workouts (these are handled separately or removed)
            - Include warmup/cooldown for all workouts
            - Provide output as an array of workouts with name, tags, and full breakdown of reps/warmups/cooldowns
            - Threshold in warmups should be a maximum of 4 minutes in total, comprising of either 1 or 2 minute reps at either LT1 or LT2 pace, with half the time of rest between reps.
            - Threshold in warmups should be the LAST thing before the workout.
            - LT2 workouts should include a threshold warmup.
            - The easy portion of warmups and cooldown should both be at least 15 minutes long.
            - IMPORTANT: Do NOT generate any LongRun or Hills workouts - these are handled separately or removed
